FORMAT OF DATA FILES (".dly" FILES)

Each ".dly" file contains data for one station.  The name of the file
corresponds to a station's identification code.  For example, "USC00026481.dly"
contains the data for the station with the identification code USC00026481).

Each record in a file contains one month of daily data.  The variables on each
line include the following:
