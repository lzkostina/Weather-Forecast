    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize the strengths of publicly available datasets, we sourced data\n",
    "from NOAA and an additional OpenWeather dataset, leveraging them as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   1.  **NOAA Dataset**  \n",
    "        The NOAA dataset provided us with historical weather data dating\n",
    "        back to January 1, 1948. Specifically, we utilized the **Global\n",
    "        Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-D)** dataset, which\n",
    "        integrates daily climate observations from approximately 30\n",
    "        sources. This comprehensive and consistent dataset includes\n",
    "        measurements which we further used in our models:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Minimum, maximum, and average temperatures,  \n",
    "    -   Precipitation,  \n",
    "    -   Snowfall, and  \n",
    "    -   Snow depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The NOAA dataset served as the backbone of our analysis, offering a\n",
    "    long-term historical perspective essential for training robust\n",
    "    prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   1.  **OpenWeather Dataset**  \n",
    "        To complement the historical data provided by NOAA, we utilized\n",
    "        the OpenWeather History API for recent weather data. This\n",
    "        dataset offers hourly historical weather data dating back to\n",
    "        January 1, 1979, and includes a wide range of weather parameters\n",
    "        such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Minimum, maximum, and average temperatures,  \n",
    "    -   Humidity,  \n",
    "    -   Precipitation details (rainfall and snowfall), and  \n",
    "    -   Wind speed and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we focused on data from 20 locations, specified by\n",
    "their geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), covering the\n",
    "period from November 12, 2024, to the day of making predictions. The\n",
    "data was retrieved using Python’s `requests` module, downloaded in\n",
    "weekly chunks to stay within the API limits. The raw data was provided\n",
    "in JSON format, requiring additional processing for integration with our\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenWeather dataset offered high-resolution, recent weather data,\n",
    "providing a contemporary perspective to complement the long-term\n",
    "historical insights from NOAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing both datasets was a critical step in preparing the\n",
    "historical weather data for analysis and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **NOAA Dataset** For NOAA dataset the main steps of the\n",
    "    preprocessing included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Format Conversion**\n",
    "    -   The raw data, provided in `.dly` format, was converted into a\n",
    "        tabular format to enable easier analysis and integration with\n",
    "        our workflow.\n",
    "2.  **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "    -   **Invalid Dates:** Removed entries with invalid dates to ensure\n",
    "        consistency.  \n",
    "    -   **Missing Average Temperatures:** Filled missing average\n",
    "        temperature values by taking the average of the maximum and\n",
    "        minimum temperatures for the same day.  \n",
    "    -   **Snowfall and Precipitation:** Replaced missing values for\n",
    "        snowfall and precipitation with zeros, assuming no snowfall or\n",
    "        rainfall occurred.  \n",
    "    -   **Invalid Temperature Values:** Fixed anomalous temperature\n",
    "        readings (e.g., values below -1000) by replacing them with the\n",
    "        previous day’s valid temperature.\n",
    "3.  **Unit Conversion**\n",
    "    -   Converted all temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit to\n",
    "        align with standard U.S. weather reporting conventions.\n",
    "4.  **Feature Selection**\n",
    "    -   Retained only the core features, including temperature (minimum,\n",
    "        maximum, and average), precipitation and snowfall for subsequent\n",
    "        model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing steps ensured the NOAA dataset was clean,\n",
    "consistent, and ready for effective integration into the predictive\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **OpenWeather Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenWeather dataset also underwent several preprocessing steps to\n",
    "prepare it for integration with the NOAA data and subsequent model\n",
    "training. The main steps included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Format Conversion**\n",
    "    -   Raw data retrieved in `.JSON` format was converted into `.csv`\n",
    "        format to facilitate analysis and storage.\n",
    "2.  **Data Aggregation**\n",
    "    -   **Time Conversion:** The UTC timestamps in the dataset were\n",
    "        converted to the local time of each city to align with\n",
    "        region-specific weather patterns.  \n",
    "    -   **Feature Extraction:** Key features, including temperature\n",
    "        (minimum, maximum, and average), precipitation, and snowfall\n",
    "        records, were extracted for analysis.  \n",
    "    -   **Daily Aggregation:** The hourly data was aggregated into daily\n",
    "        data by:\n",
    "        -   Calculating the daily average, minimum, and maximum\n",
    "            temperatures.  \n",
    "        -   Summing total precipitation and snowfall for each day.\n",
    "3.  **Dataset Integration**\n",
    "    -   The processed OpenWeather data, covering the period from\n",
    "        November 12 to November 25, 2024, was merged with the processed\n",
    "        NOAA data to create a unified dataset for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing steps ensured consistency between the two datasets\n",
    "and prepared the data for effective model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code used for data downloading and preprocessing is provided in the\n",
    "Appendix section of this report for reference. Additionally, the\n",
    "original code can be found in the analysis folder, and the raw and\n",
    "processed data are stored in the data folder of our GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression-Based Weather Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining and preprocessing the data, we framed weather\n",
    "forecasting as a regression problem. By using past weather data as\n",
    "features and future temperature data as labels, we were able to approach\n",
    "this task systematically within a supervised learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the project was to minimize the Mean Squared\n",
    "Error between the predicted and actual temperature values. Thus, we\n",
    "continued our analysis with preparing regression dataset in the\n",
    "following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Features**:\n",
    "    -   A flattened array of the previous 30 days’ data, including:\n",
    "        -   Minimum temperature (TMIN)  \n",
    "        -   Average temperature (TAVG)  \n",
    "        -   Maximum temperature (TMAX)  \n",
    "        -   Snowfall (SNOW)  \n",
    "        -   Precipitation (PRCP)\n",
    "2.  **Labels**:\n",
    "    -   A flattened array of the next 5 days’ data, focusing on:\n",
    "        -   Minimum temperature (TMIN)  \n",
    "        -   Average temperature (TAVG)  \n",
    "        -   Maximum temperature (TMAX)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Range\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure robust model evaluation and fair predictions, the data range\n",
    "was divided as follows:  \n",
    "- **Model Training**:  \n",
    "- Models were trained on data excluding the evaluation days, with a\n",
    "buffer to prevent any data leakage.  \n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**:  \n",
    "- To simulate real-world test conditions, evaluation was conducted on\n",
    "data from November 25 to December 10 for each of the past five years.  \n",
    "- For each evaluation day, predictions were made for the subsequent 5\n",
    "days.  \n",
    "- This approach ensured that the evaluation set closely resembled the\n",
    "actual test scenario in timing and structure.  \n",
    "- **Final Prediction**:  \n",
    "- After selecting the best-performing model, it was trained on the full\n",
    "dataset from January 1, 2014, to October 31, 2024, to generate the final\n",
    "predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach to training, evaluation, and prediction ensured\n",
    "a clear separation between training and testing phases while leveraging\n",
    "historical and recent data to create a robust predictive framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the weather forecasting challenge, we trained a series of\n",
    "predictors using diverse methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Previous Day Predictor**  \n",
    "-   **Average Last Week Predictor**  \n",
    "-   **Linear Regression**  \n",
    "-   **Ridge Regression**  \n",
    "-   **LASSO**  \n",
    "-   **Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we developed a **Weighted Average Predictor**, which\n",
    "combines the outputs of the above predictors using optimized weights to\n",
    "improve overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Baseline Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a benchmark for comparison, we implemented two simple\n",
    "baseline predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Previous Day Predictor**\n",
    "    -   **Approach**: Uses the last recorded day’s weather data to\n",
    "        predict the next 5 days.  \n",
    "    -   **Mechanism**: Repeats today’s values (TMIN, TAVG, TMAX) for the\n",
    "        subsequent 5 days.  \n",
    "    -   **Strengths**:\n",
    "        -   Extremely simple and fast.  \n",
    "        -   Requires no training.  \n",
    "    -   **Limitations**:\n",
    "        -   Assumes static weather patterns, making it less effective during \n",
    "            rapid weather changes.\n",
    "2.  **Average Last Week Predictor**\n",
    "    -   **Approach**: Averages the last 7 days of weather data to\n",
    "        generate predictions.  \n",
    "    -   **Mechanism**: Calculates the mean TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX over the\n",
    "        past week and repeats these averages for the next 5 days.  \n",
    "    -   **Strengths**:\n",
    "        -   More robust to daily fluctuations compared to the Previous\n",
    "            Day Predictor.  \n",
    "    -   **Limitations**:\n",
    "        -   Assumes weekly averages accurately reflect future trends,\n",
    "            which might not always hold especially during abrupt weather changes.\n",
    "            \n",
    "While both baseline predictors are straightforward to implement, they\n",
    "come with inherent limitations, particularly in their assumptions about\n",
    "weather patterns. These predictors served as useful references, enabling\n",
    "us to evaluate the performance of more sophisticated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression-Based Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the baseline predictors, we advanced to\n",
    "regression-based models to better capture complex weather patterns. For\n",
    "these models, the features consisted of the last 30 days of weather\n",
    "data, specifically TMIN, TAVG, TMAX, SNOW, and PRCP (precipitation),\n",
    "which were flattened into a single feature vector of size 30 x 5 = 150.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Strength**:\n",
    "    -   Simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient, making it a \n",
    "        good starting point for understanding relationships between features \n",
    "        and targets.  \n",
    "    -   Provides clear coefficients that explain the relationship\n",
    "        between features and the target variable.  \n",
    "-   **Limitation**:\n",
    "    -   Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target,\n",
    "        which limits its ability to model more complex weather patterns\n",
    "        or interactions between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ridge Regression (5-fold with RidgeCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Approach**:\n",
    "    -   Ridge regression was applied with a regularization parameter\n",
    "        $(\\alpha)$ tuned via 5-fold cross-validation using RidgeCV.  \n",
    "-   **Strength**:\n",
    "    -   Handles multicollinearity effectively, reducing the potential\n",
    "        for overfitting by shrinking the coefficients.  \n",
    "-   **Limitation**:\n",
    "    -   Despite regularization, it still assumes linear relationships\n",
    "        between the features and target, which may not fully capture\n",
    "        nonlinear weather patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LASSO Regression (5-fold with LassoCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Approach**:\n",
    "    -   LASSO regression was also tuned using 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "        with LassoCV.  \n",
    "-   **Strength**:\n",
    "    -   Particularly useful for feature selection, as it tends to shrink\n",
    "        coefficients of less important features to zero.  \n",
    "-   **Limitation**:\n",
    "    -   LASSO may drop important features if they are highly correlated\n",
    "        with others, which could result in the loss of valuable\n",
    "        predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These regression-based models introduced more complexity compared to the\n",
    "baseline predictors, and their strengths and limitations reflect the\n",
    "trade-off between interpretability and the ability to capture complex\n",
    "relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest and Weighted Average Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring linear and regularized regression models, we turned to\n",
    "more complex machine learning models, such as Random Forest, to capture\n",
    "nonlinear relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest (GridSearchCV with 5-fold Cross-Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Features**: Same as Linear Regression (150 features, including\n",
    "    TMIN, TAVG, TMAX, SNOW, and PRCP for the past 30 days).  \n",
    "-   **Strength**:\n",
    "    -   Random Forests excel at handling complex patterns and\n",
    "        interactions between features, which are common in weather\n",
    "        data.  \n",
    "    -   Provides feature importance, allowing us to identify which\n",
    "        variables contribute most to the model’s predictions.  \n",
    "-   **Limitation**:\n",
    "    -   Computationally intensive, especially as the number of trees and\n",
    "        data size increases. Training and prediction times may be longer\n",
    "        compared to simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Average Predictor (Custom Cross-Validation over Weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Approach**:\n",
    "    -   The Weighted Average Predictor combines predictions from\n",
    "        multiple models by calculating a weighted average of their\n",
    "        outputs.  \n",
    "    -   Weights for each model’s prediction are generated randomly using\n",
    "        a Dirichlet distribution, and each weight combination is\n",
    "        evaluated based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE). The\n",
    "        best-performing weights are then selected.  \n",
    "-   **Features and Targets**:\n",
    "    -   Features and targets are the same as those used in the\n",
    "        individual models, with weights applied to the predictions of\n",
    "        each model.  \n",
    "-   **Strength**:\n",
    "    -   By combining predictions from multiple models, this approach\n",
    "        improves accuracy and captures complementary patterns that\n",
    "        individual models may miss.  \n",
    "-   **Limitation**:\n",
    "    -   The quality of the model depends heavily on the choice of\n",
    "        weights, which could lead to suboptimal performance if not\n",
    "        carefully optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models represent a natural progression from simpler linear models\n",
    "to more sophisticated ensemble methods, with the goal of improving\n",
    "prediction accuracy by capturing complex relationships in the data. The\n",
    "Random Forest provides a powerful tool for identifying complex patterns,\n",
    "while the Weighted Average Predictor serves as a way to combine multiple\n",
    "model outputs for enhanced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After training and evaluating the Weighted Average Predictor, we\n",
    "determined the optimal weights to assign to each model in the ensemble.\n",
    "Our final configuration gave full weight to the Ridge Regression model,\n",
    "with a weight of 1.0, and assigned zero weight to the other models\n",
    "(Lasso, Random Forest, and Baselines). This weight configuration was\n",
    "chosen to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which resulted in an\n",
    "optimal MSE of 49.97.\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical NOAA data, supplemented with current OpenWeather data,\n",
    "served as the foundation for our predictions. For evaluation, we used\n",
    "the period from Nov 25 to Dec 10 of the past five years, ensuring that\n",
    "the evaluation set was representative of real-world forecasting\n",
    "conditions. Our weighted model, which included a variety of predictors\n",
    "such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, provided a robust\n",
    "forecasting tool. The final result was a Ridge Regression model trained\n",
    "on temperature, snowfall, and precipitation from the past 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the accessibility and reproducibility of our results, we\n",
    "packaged the entire workflow into a Docker image. This step allows\n",
    "anyone interested to easily run our models with minimal setup, ensuring\n",
    "that the results can be verified and applied in different environments.\n",
    "This approach highlights the importance of not only developing accurate\n",
    "models but also making them accessible and reproducible for future use.\n",
